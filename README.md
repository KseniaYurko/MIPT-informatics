Continuing to study the C++ language

## 1. Operator overloading  
Overload operations (elementary operations, comparison operations, input/output operations) for the rational class (a class of rational fractions)

1. **1_class_rational.cpp:**  
    The main script containing the overload of all operators and function `reduction(int &a, int &b)` reducing fraction, function `change_sign(int &a, int &b)` to bring it to the standard form of rational fraction.

2. **reduction.cpp:**  
    Description of the function that reduces the numerator and denominator.

2. **test.cpp:**  
    Explanation of the topic operator overload, work in class.
