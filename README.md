## Operator overloading
Overload operations (elementary operations, comparison operations, input/output operations) for the rational class (a class of rational fractions)

* ###### Elementary operations
    - binary sum (`+`)
    - binary substruction (`-`)
    - binary multiply (`*`)
    - binary division (`/`)

* ###### Comparison operations
    - assigment (`=`)
    - comparison (`==`)
    - more (`>`)
    - less (`<`)

* ###### Comparison operations
    - output (`>>`)
    - input (`<<`)
